## üîÅ Game Flow

1. **Game Initialization**
    - Game takes in board size and player list
    - Initializes `Board` and `WinningStrategy`

2. **Main Game Loop**
    - While status is `IN_PROGRESS`:
        - Get move from current player
        - Validate move (bounds + empty cell)
        - Apply move to board
        - Check for winner using `WinningStrategy`
        - If no winner, switch player
        - If board is full, mark as `DRAW`

3. **Win Checking**
    - Implemented using Strategy pattern
    - `DefaultWinningStrategy` checks:
        - Row
        - Column
        - Diagonal
        - Anti-diagonal

- Allows future extension with `BotPlayer`

### `Board`

- Validates and applies moves
- Prints the current board

- Decouples rule engine from core game

### `DefaultWinningStrategy`
